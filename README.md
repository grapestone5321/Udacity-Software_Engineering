## Software Development Process
byGeorgia Institute of Technology

From Idea to Product

This class is offered as CS6300 at Georgia Tech where it is a part of the Online Masters Degree (OMS). 

Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.

In SDP, you will learn how to select and implement the ideal software process for your development project. 

Through Professor Orso's engaging examples and interviews with industry insiders, you will learn both conceptual and practical aspects of software engineering. 

The course covers requirements engineering, architecture and design, testing and maintenance, and software quality in general.

The goal of this class is to equip you with the skills necessary to define requirements, set up an integrated development environment (IDE), learn Git (and Github!) and use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to design and build an Android application. 

We will also examine several testing practices and refactoring techniques that are helpful before the launch of your software project.

While everyone working with software should have these skills, they are particularly important for Software Engineers and Engineering Managers.
